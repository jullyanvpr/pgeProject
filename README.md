# PGE Coding Test

## What is it?
It's a simple static website, built for showing 3 different charts, each one in a different page.

## How was it built?
The technologies employed are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website is responsive. Considering good accessibility practices, I used semantic HTML tags, BEM architecture for CSS and the colors are within the WebAim standards.
